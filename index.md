# Edocon Developer

## My Projects
I'm working on the following projects: 
* a web **search engine**.
* a simple page for a blog

## My actual skills
I started from HTML5 and CSS. Now I'm learning markdown and it's specific uses on Github.

## About Jekill

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## About Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. 

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Edocon999/pro/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
