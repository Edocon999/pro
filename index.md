## My Projects

I'm working on the following projects: 
* a web **search engine**.
* a simple page for a blog

## My actual skills

I started from HTML5 and CSS. Now I'm learning markdown and it's specific uses on Github.

## About Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing.

A table example:

| Name      | Surname |
| ----- | ----- |
| John      | Doe       |
| Robin   | Hood        |

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## About Jekill

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Edocon999/pro/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
